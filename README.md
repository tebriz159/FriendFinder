An app to pair you up with someone with similar interests. 
https://hidden-earth-46755.herokuapp.com/

## Usage
Click [here](https://hidden-earth-46755.herokuapp.com/) to visit the deployed app.

You will fill out a 10-question survey, including your name and a link to your picture. Then, we will compare your results to previous users and send you back your closest match! 

Each time you take the survey, you will be added to the database to match with future users to match with. If you are already in the database, you will not be added again, but just compared to other users and matched with your buddy.
If you wish to remove yourself from the database, please contact me at yousef.eddy@gmail.com.
